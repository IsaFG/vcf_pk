"param_name_vector"	"param_descr_vector"
"version"	"Possible values: v3, v4"
"species"	"Name of the species, e.g.: hsapiens. For a full list of potentially available species ids, please refer to: http://bioinfo.hpc.cam.ac.uk/cellbase/webservices/rest/v4/meta/species"
"assembly"	"Set the reference genome assembly, e.g. grch38. For a full list ofpotentially available assemblies, please refer to: http://bioinfo.hpc.cam.ac.uk/cellbase/webservices/rest/v4/meta/species"
"exclude"	"Set which fields are excluded in the response, e.g.: transcripts.exons.  Please note that this option may not be enabled for all web services."
"include"	"Set which fields are included in the response, e.g.: transcripts.id.  Please note that this parameter may not be enabled for all web services."
"limit"	"Max number of results to be returned. No limit applied when -1. Please note that this option may not be available for all web services."
"skip"	"Number of results to be skipped. No skip applied when -1.  Please note that this option may not be available for all web services."
"skipCount"	"Skip counting the total number of results. In other words, will leave numTotalResults in the QueryResult object to -1. This can make queries much faster. Please note that this option may not be available for all web services."

"normalize"	"Boolean to indicate whether input variants shall be normalized or not. Normalization process includes decomposing MNVs"
"phased"	"Boolean to indicate whether phase should be considered during the annotation process"
"useCache"	"useCache=true is discouraged unless the server administrator advises so. Boolean to indicate whether cached annotation should be used or not"
"imprecise"	"Boolean to indicate whether imprecise search must be used or not"
"svExtraPadding"	"Integer to optionally provide the size of the extra padding to be used when annotating imprecise (or not) structural variants"
